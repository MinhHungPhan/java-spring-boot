# Spring Boot Dev Tools

## Introduction
This repository contains a tutorial on using Spring Boot Dev Tools. It aims to help developers overcome the issue of manually restarting their Spring Boot applications every time they make changes to the source code.

## Problem
Running Spring Boot applications requires manual application restarts after making changes to the source code, which can be cumbersome and time-consuming.

## Solution
To address this problem, we can leverage **spring-boot-devtools**. This library provides an automatic application restart feature whenever the code is updated, eliminating the need for manual restarts. The best part is that no additional code needs to be written.

## IntelliJ Configuration
While other IDEs may offer this functionality out of the box, IntelliJ Community Edition requires some additional setup to work with Spring Boot Dev Tools. Follow these steps to configure IntelliJ:

1. Open the **Preferences** menu and navigate to **Build, Execution, Deployment** > **Compiler**.
2. In the Compiler dialog box, check the **Build Project Automatically** checkbox.

Additionally, we need to adjust the following setting:

1. Go to **Preferences** > **Advanced Settings**.
2. Check the **Allow Auto-Make to Start** checkbox.

Once these settings are configured, IntelliJ Community Edition will be compatible with Spring Boot Dev Tools.

## Development Process
Here's a summary of the development process:

1. Apply the IntelliJ configurations described above.
2. Edit the `pom.xml` file and add the `spring-boot-devtools` dependency.
Add new code, such as a REST endpoint, to your application.
Verify that the application is automatically reloaded when changes are made.

## Getting Started
To get started with Spring Boot Dev Tools, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open your preferred IDE, such as IntelliJ Community Edition.
3. Configure IntelliJ using the instructions provided above.
4. Edit the `pom.xml` file and add the following dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
5. Write your code, make changes, and test the automatic reload feature.

## Conclusion
That's it! With Spring Boot Dev Tools and the IntelliJ configurations in place, you can streamline your development workflow and eliminate the need for manual application restarts.

Enjoy coding with Spring Boot Dev Tools!
